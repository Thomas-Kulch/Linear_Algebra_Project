# Linear Algebra Project

In this project, 
    
    - I develop a k nearest neighbors function to test how close an object is to a specified object across different distance metrics. I did this with scaled and unscaled data to measure differences.
    
    - I measured whether the KNN approach can do better than a dummy model in terms of F1 score. I built a KNN classifier to do this and tried to determine if a dummy model is able to compare to the KNN classifier. 
    
    - I built my own Linear Regression implementation and measured RMSE and R2 scores for both the original and scaled data.
    
    - I obfuscated the data to mask the personal identification features. This is useful when dealing with clients who would not like this data to be scene and should be kept private. I tested if this method of masking the data would affect the RMSE or R2 results of our Linear Regression model.
